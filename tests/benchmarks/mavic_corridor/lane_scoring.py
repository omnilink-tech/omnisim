"""Lane-offset scoring for a kept corridor trajectory.

This measures how far off its intended lane the aircraft flies, and how long it
takes to come back after a disturbance. It exists because the third failure
signature of the corridor benchmark cannot be read off the summary metrics: a
contact that is survived locally delays lane recovery, and an obstacle corner
sitting inside the recovery distance is what collects. Completion stays 8/8 and
minimum clearance moves only at that one corner, so nothing in the summary says
which of the two happened.

Everything here runs on samples already in the mission JSON (written by
`--keep-trajectories`), so a question about a past campaign is answered by
re-scoring rather than re-flying.

Three rules decide every number, and all three are in this module rather than in
prose because each has already produced a disagreement when left implicit.

**Leg assignment** is forward-only nearest segment by clamped point-to-segment
distance. The obvious alternative, advancing when the projection parameter on the
current leg exceeds 1, does not work on a serpentine: on a leg perpendicular to
the direction of travel that parameter does not grow, so the index sticks and a
sample 9 m downstream gets scored as an excursion on a leg the aircraft left long
ago.

**The station anchor.** A station is a distance ALONG the leg from its start
waypoint, not an absolute coordinate, so the same station means the same thing on
every leg whatever direction it runs. The reading is the first sample at or past
that distance after the leg's anchor, where the anchor is the sample of closest
approach to the start waypoint. Without an anchor the reading is ambiguous rather
than merely noisy: an aircraft that rounds a corner wide crosses a near station
three times, outbound, back, and once more settling, and on one real flight those
three readings differed by 2.5 m. The anchor selects the outbound pass and
nothing else.

**In-turn stations return None.** If the anchor already lies at or past the
station, the aircraft was still turning when it passed there, and a number would
describe how wide the corner was taken rather than how fast the lane was
recovered. Those are different quantities, and mixing them is how a station that
looked informative on one machine turned out to be measuring the turn on another.
None is the honest answer; `station_table` reports it as "in-turn".

Offsets are signed, positive to the LEFT of the direction of travel, so the mean
says which side of the lane the aircraft flew and not only how far off it was.
