"""lane_scoring's three rules, on synthetic trajectories.

No engine. Every case here is geometry chosen so the expected value is exact,
which is the point: the numbers this module produces were disputed between two
machines while the rules lived in prose, and the same sample admitted readings
of +0.49, +1.25 and +3.02 depending on which crossing of a station the reader
took. `test_station_is_the_first_crossing_after_the_anchor` is that case, pinned.
